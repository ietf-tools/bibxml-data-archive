<abstract><t>This document describes proposed extensions to the GSMPv3 protocol to allow its use in a broadband environment, as a control plane between Access Nodes (e.g. DSLAM) and Broadband Network Gateways (e.g. NAS). These proposed extensions are required to realize a protocol for “Access Node Control” mechanism as described in [9]. The resulting protocol with the proposed extensions to GSMPv3 [4] is referred to as “Access Node Control Protocol” (ANCP). This document focuses on specific use cases of access node control mechanism for topology discovery, line configuration, and OAM. It is intended to be augmented by additional protocol specification for future use cases considered in scope by the ANCP charter.</t></abstract>
