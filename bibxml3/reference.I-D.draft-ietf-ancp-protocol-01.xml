<abstract><t>This document describes proposed extensions to the GSMPv3 protocol to allow its use in a broadband environment, as a control plane between Access Nodes (e.g. DSLAM) and Broadband Network Gateways (e.g. NAS). These proposed extensions are required to realize a protocol for “Access Node Control” mechanism as described in [8]. The resulting protocol with the proposed extensions to GSMPv3 [4] is referred to as “Access Node Control Protocol” (ANCP). This document currently focuses on specific use cases of access node control mechanism for topology discovery, line configuration, and OAM as described in ANCP framework document [8]. It is intended to be augmented by additional protocol specification for future use cases considered in scope by the ANCP charter. ANCP framework document [8] describes the ANCP use-cases in detail. Illustrative text for the use-cases is included here to help the protocol implementer understand the greater context of ANCP protocol interactions.</t></abstract>
