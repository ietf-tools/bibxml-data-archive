<abstract><t>This document described the procedures for interconnecting two or more Network Virtualization Overlays (NVOs) via NVO over IP-only network.  The solution interconnects Ethernet VPN network by using NVO with Ethernet VPN (EVPN) to facilitate the interconnect in a scalable fashion.  The motivation is to support extension of Layer-2 and Layer-3, Unicast and Multicast, VPNs without having to rely on typical Data Center Interconnect (DCI) technologies like MPLS/VPLS. The requirements for the interconnect are similar to the ones specified in RFC7209 [RFC7209] &quot;Requirements for Ethernet VPN (EVPN)&quot;.  In particular, this document describes the difference of the Gateways (GWs) procedure and incremental functionality from [RFC9014] &quot;Interconnect Solution for Ethernet VPN (EVPN) Overlay Networks&quot;, which this solution is interoperable with.  This document is OBSOLETE and replaced by [SHARMA-BESS-MULTI-SITE].</t></abstract>
